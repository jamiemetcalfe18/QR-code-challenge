## My process
I started off by coloring the background in, and focusing on putting the qr code and text in the right position with flexbox. I then focused in on making everything the right size, or as close to it as I possibly could to the picture given. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This was a really good review for me with flexbox. I need a lot more practice with it in my opinion, I am pretty rusty. I found it very hard to match the background color and font sizes, I need to figure out if there is an easier way to do that in the future. 

### Continued development
If I were to improve upon this, I would intregrate this into a much bigger ad.
